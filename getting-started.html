                            This getting started guide will walk you through sending your first Sigfox message, setting up basic callbacks and configuring the downlink protocol. If you're new to Sigfox and want to jump start your Sigfox development, you'll find everything you need here! This guide will start by assuming you are using an external processor/MCU to communicate with the Sigfox module.

                            In order to start using the Sigfox network, you'll need to firstly register your device and an account on the Sigfox network. If you're joining the network as a Maker with a Dev Kit or with a small number of prototypes you'll be able to start using Sigfox immediately. If you're already building devices at scale and want to start deploying them, please get in touch and we'll make sure you have the right account set up.

                            Navigate to the <a href="https://backend.sigfox.com/activate">activate</a> webpage and choose your Dev Kit provider. Next select your country and respective service provider. Find your device's Device ID and PAC number as you'll need these for activation (can be found on the box of your device). You'll then be asked to enter a few details and to create an account. </p>
                        <p>
                        Once you've done this, you should be registered on the SIGFOX Backend! Check the email account that you registered with and you should have a link inviting you to activate your account. The device you registered should now appear in your account.

                        <p>
                            Sigfox messages are designed to be smaller, optimised for sensors and require only a small amount of power to transmit. The Sigfox payload is limited to 12 bytes (excluding the payload headers). An 'uplink' or device to base station message is broadcast by the device for approximately <strong>6 seconds</strong> at a rate of <strong>100 bit/s</strong> (within the RCZ1). Although this might seem like a very restricted message payload, there's actually a lot that can be done with 12 bytes!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The example below shows how you could structure 12 bytes to send a set of GPS coordinates along with speed, acquistion time and the voltage of a battery.

                <p>There are a few of different ways to send a Sigfox message, this guide will walk you through the two simplest; using AT commands and utilising a device library.</p>
            </div>

                    <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
                        <h5>AT Commands</h5>
                        <p>
                            AT Commands at the lowest level of interaction that you'll interact with a Sigfox Module (Unless you're using an SDK). Most commonly you'll interact with a Sigfox Module by using a serial interface, specifically UART. You'll address the module with a command to initalise it, prepare it for transmission and then pass your payload or message to it for transmission.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code class="round-code">AT$SF=0123CAFE\r</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Note -</strong> AT commands are sent in Hexidecimal so ensure that you encode your data in this format.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
                        <h5>Connecting with Serial UART</h5>
                        <p>
                            In order to send across the AT command shown earlier, we need to communicate between a device and it's Sigfox module. Below is an example of opening a serial connection between and Arduino Uno and a Sigfox module.
                        </p>

<pre><code class="round-code">#include &lt;SerialSoftware.h&gt;
#define TX 4
#define RX 5

SoftwareSerial sigfox(RX,TX);

void setup()
{
sigfox.begin(9600); // Initalise Serial connection
sigfox.write("AT$SF=0123CAFE\r"); // Serial write to Sigfox Module
}

void loop(){}

                        <h5>Using Libraries</h5>
                        <p>
                            Libraries are abstractions of the AT Command interface and allow you to quickly and easily send messages without worrying about changing your payload into its hexidemical representation and ensuring that you're complying with the ETSI Duty Cycle Restrictions. There are a number of custom libraries that have been for various platforms. Examples of these are coming soon...

                      <h4>What is a Callback?</h4>
                      <p>Sending your message is easy... what about retrieving it? Sigfox makes it easy to retrieve your data from our cloud service by the use of Callbacks. Callbacks are a service that allows Sigfox to push an event to your server upon an event. For example, your device might send a Sigfox message upon an external trigger; you might want to be notified once this event had occured. This would be the idea case to use a Callback; the Sigfox server would relay your message via a POST/GET request to your own server. In addition to defining your own server and data, Sigfox also allows you to transfer your data with simplified bridges such as AWS IoT and Microsoft Azure.</p>
                      <p>We'll start by looking at how to utilise Custom Callbacks and then move onto utilising specific services.</p>

                      <h4>Custom Callback</h4>
                      <p>To setup a custom Callback, you need to initalise a few different features on the Sigfox Backend. We'll assume at this point your device and account have already been registered and that you know how to transmit a message.</p>

							  This field allows you to specify how you would like Sigfox to decode your device's payload. You might for example wish to decode an incoming byte as an unsigned integer. An example of this is the first line of the sample below:
						  </p>
<pre><code>int1::uint:8 // Unsigned integer of 8 bits with name int1
str::char:6 // Character String of 6 letters with name str
b1::bool:7 // Boolean based on value of bit in position 7 with name b1

                        <h4>What is a Downlink Message?</h4>
                        <p>The Sigfox protocol supports bi-directional communication. This means that you can set up your Sigfox module to request data from the Sigfox servers. This is called a downlink message. Your Sigfox device sends an uplink message to the Sigfox servers requesting a downlink message, waits for a specified period of 30 seconds. As with the uplink message the device expects to receive a 8 byte payload.</p>
                        <p>
                            Due to the nature of how the device initates the downlink rather than the base station, the downlink messages are commonly used for configuration. An example might be a device that has multiple sensors on board for collecting data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due to ETSI regulation, the devices are limited to 4 downlink messages a day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
