            <h3>About Sigfox</h3>
            <h4>Basics</h4>
              <p>
        Sigfox is dedicated to giving a voice to the physical world, thanks to our dedicated network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The service focuses on:
        <ul>
          <li>Simplicity : No configuration, no connection, no signaling</li>
          <li>Autonomy : Very low energy consumption, allowing years of autonomy on battery without maintenance</li>
          <li>Small messages : No large assets or multimedia, only small messages</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
          
        <h4>Sending a message</h4>
  <p>There is no signaling, nor negotiation between a device and a receiving station. <br />
  The device decices when to send its message, picking up a pseudo-random frequency.<br />
  It's up to the network to detect the incoming messages, as well as validating & deduplicating them.<br />
  The message is then available in the Sigfox cloud, and forwarded to any 3rd party cloud platform chosen by the user.
    </p>
        <p>
          Messages can be sent <b>to the device</b> as well. For energy efficiency reasons, every communication is instigated by the device.<br />
          This means that the device is not passively listening possible incoming data, but stays idle 99.x% of the time<br />
          A device can <i>ask</i> for an update from a network. Then it will go back to sleep from 20 secs, before starting to listen to a specific frequency.<br />
          The <i>downlink</i> message can be either a static one (hardcoded, or updated through API call), or a dynamic one sent instantly by the user's own application server.
          </p>
    <h4>Security</h4>
  <p>
  Every message is signed, with information proper to the device (incl. a unique private key) and to the message itself. <br />
  This prevent spoofing, alteration or replay of genuine messages. <br />
  Encryption & scrambling of the data are supported, with the choice of the more appropriate solution up to the consumer.
  </p>  
          <h4>Retrieving your data</h4>
          <p>
          You have 3 main ways to interact with the data you send to the Sigfox network :
            <ul>
              <li>Visual : through the backend.sigfox.com interface</li>
              <li>API : a REST API allows you to pull your data & relevant stats</li>
              <li>Callbacks : a webhook mechanism, that will <b>push</b> every new incoming message to your own application servers. Thes are fully customisable HTTPS requests : http method, headers, content-type, request body format</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h4>Radio Zones</h4>
    <p>The SIGFOX network is relying on Ultra-Narrow Band(UNB) modulation, and operating in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. <br />
    This protocol offer a great resistance to jamming & standard interferers, as well as a great capacity per receiving base stations
    SIGFOX complies with local regulations, adjusting central frequency, power output and duty cycles.
