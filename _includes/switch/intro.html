    <h3 class="mdl-typography--font-thin mdl-typography--text-center">Many of the products already developed for SUB-GHz technology
are already compatible with our long range radio technology.</h3>
    <p class="mdl-typography--font-thin mdl-typography--text-center">
      Thanks to our « open hardware » approach,  we work with many semiconductors companies offering compatible radio chipsets, used for many radio protocols.<br />
      If you’re using this chipset for other purposes today, it could  be possible to reuse the same hardware and be Sigfox compatible !
      By adding the Sigfox library and upgrading the firmware, your device might talk our language and enjoy new possibilities !
